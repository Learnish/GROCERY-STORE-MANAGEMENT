# GROCERY-STORE-MANAGEMENT




 THIS IS A SQL BASED PROJECT WHICH AIMS TO HELP MANAGE A GROCERY SHOP USING DATA EXPLORATION,DATA RETRIEVAL AND DATA MANIPULATION ,IT ALSO HELPS THE OWNER TO MAKE DESICIONS REGARDING CERTAIN ASPECTS OF HIS SHOP WHICH CAN LEAD TO GROWTH OF HIS SHOP BOTH IN TERMS OF MONETARY BENEFIT AND  SHOP MAINTENANCE.
 
 
 THE DATASET INCLUDES FIVE TABLES CUSTOMER ,ORDERDETAILS,ITEM,PRODUCT AND SUPPLIER WHICH ARE RELATED TO EACH OTHER THUS MAKING OUR DATASET A RELATIONAL DATABASE AND THAT IS EXACTLY THE REASON I HAVE USED SQL IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED RESULTS.
 
 ONE CAN REFER :
 
1.THE SCHEMA FILE(DATABASE SCHEMA GROCERY.PNG) ATTACHED IN ORDER TO SEE THE RELATION BETWEEN ALL 5 TABLES.

2.THE PROBLEM FILE(PROBLEMS SOLVED.PDF) ATTACHED IN ORDER TO SEE THE PROBLEMS.

3.THE OUTPUT FILE(OUTPUT SNIPPETS (1).PDF) ATTACHED IN ORDER TO SEE THE OUTPUT RECEIVED ON RUNNING OUR QUERIES.

4.AND FINALY THE SQLFILE IS ATTACHED SO THAT U CAN SEE THE QUERIES USED IN ORDER TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS AND REACH THE OUTPUT.
